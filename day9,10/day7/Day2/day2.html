<b>About Fast Foods</b>

<pre>
A fast-food restaurant, also known as a quick-service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast-food cuisine
and has minimal table service. The food served in fast-food restaurants is typically part of a "meat-sweet diet", offered from a limited menu, cooked
in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. Fast-food 
restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provides standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and
supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term "fast food" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriamâ€“Webster in 1951.[1]

Arguably, fast-food restaurants originated in the United States with White Castle in 1921.[2][unreliable source?] Today, American-founded fast-food 
chains such as McDonald's (est. 1940) and KFC (est. 1952)[3][4][5][6] are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe.

Variations on the fast-food restaurant concept include fast-casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast-casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, 
offering a hybrid between counter-service typical at fast-food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant. Catering trucks (also called food trucks)
often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.
